	// LSP - it applies to inheritance in such a way that the derived classes must 
	//	be completely substituatable for their base classes.
	// LSP - in another words, if class A is subtype of class B then we should be 
	//	able to replace B with A without interrupting the behaviour of program	
	
	// ISP - it states that the large interfaces split into smaller onces because the implementation classes use only
		//the methods that are required. we should not force the client to use the methods that they don't want to use.
	
// DIP - this principle states that we should use abstraction (abstract class or interface ) instead of 
//concrete implementations. HIght level modules should not depend on the low level module but both should
		//depend on the abstraction
